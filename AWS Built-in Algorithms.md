## Tabular
Amazon SageMaker provides built-in algorithms that are tailored to the analysis of tabular data. Tabular data refers to any datasets that are organized in tables consisting of rows (observations) and columns (features). The built-in SageMaker algorithms for tabular data can be used for either classification or regression problems.

### AutoGluon
AutoGluon-Tabular is a popular open-source AutoML framework that trains highly accurate machine learning models on an unprocessed tabular dataset. Unlike existing AutoML frameworks that primarily focus on model and hyperparameter selection, AutoGluon-Tabular succeeds by ensembling multiple models and stacking them in multiple layers.

AutoGluon-Tabular performs advanced data processing, deep learning, and multi-layer model ensemble methods. It automatically recognizes the data type in each column for robust data preprocessing, including special handling of text fields.

AutoGluon fits various models ranging from off-the-shelf boosted trees to customized neural networks. These models are ensembled in a novel way: models are stacked in multiple layers and trained in a layer-wise manner that guarantees raw data can be translated into high-quality predictions within a given time constraint. This process mitigates overfitting by splitting the data in various ways with careful tracking of out-of-fold examples.

The AutoGluon-Tabular algorithm performs well in machine learning competitions because of its robust handling of a variety of data types, relationships, and distributions. You can use AutoGluon-Tabular for regression, classification (binary and multiclass), and ranking problems.

Please find the demo example [here](https://github.com/ankitakotadiya/Data-Engineering-ML/blob/main/SageMaker-Buit-in-Algorithms/Amazon_Tabular_Regression_AutoGluon.ipynb).


### CatBoost
CatBoost is a popular and high-performance open-source implementation of the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm. GBDT is a supervised learning algorithm that attempts to accurately predict a target variable by combining an ensemble of estimates from a set of simpler and weaker models.

### Factorization Machines Algorithm
The Factorization Machines algorithm is a general-purpose supervised learning algorithm that you can use for both classification and regression tasks. It is an extension of a linear model that is designed to capture interactions between features within high dimensional sparse datasets economically. For example, in a click prediction system, the Factorization Machines model can capture click rate patterns observed when ads from a certain ad-category are placed on pages from a certain page-category. Factorization machines are a good choice for tasks dealing with high dimensional sparse datasets, such as click prediction and item recommendation.

The Amazon SageMaker Factorization Machines algorithm is highly scalable and can train across distributed instances. We recommend training and inference with CPU instances for both sparse and dense datasets. In some circumstances, training with one or more GPUs on dense data might provide some benefit. Training with GPUs is available only on dense data. Use CPU instances for sparse data. The Factorization Machines algorithm supports P2, P3, G4dn, and G5 instances for training and inference.

You can tune the following hyperparameters for the Factorization Machines algorithm. The initialization parameters that contain the terms bias, linear, and factorization depend on their initialization method. There are three initialization methods: uniform, normal, and constant. These initialization methods are not themselves tunable. The parameters that are tunable are dependent on this choice of the initialization method. For example, if the initialization method is uniform, then only the scale parameters are tunable. Specifically, if bias_init_method==uniform, then bias_init_scale, linear_init_scale, and factors_init_scale are tunable. Similarly, if the initialization method is normal, then only sigma parameters are tunable. If the initialization method is constant, then only value parameters are tunable. These dependencies are listed in the following table.
