## Tabular
Amazon SageMaker provides built-in algorithms that are tailored to the analysis of tabular data. Tabular data refers to any datasets that are organized in tables consisting of rows (observations) and columns (features). The built-in SageMaker algorithms for tabular data can be used for either classification or regression problems.

### AutoGluon
AutoGluon-Tabular is a popular open-source AutoML framework that trains highly accurate machine learning models on an unprocessed tabular dataset. Unlike existing AutoML frameworks that primarily focus on model and hyperparameter selection, AutoGluon-Tabular succeeds by ensembling multiple models and stacking them in multiple layers.

AutoGluon-Tabular performs advanced data processing, deep learning, and multi-layer model ensemble methods. It automatically recognizes the data type in each column for robust data preprocessing, including special handling of text fields.

AutoGluon fits various models ranging from off-the-shelf boosted trees to customized neural networks. These models are ensembled in a novel way: models are stacked in multiple layers and trained in a layer-wise manner that guarantees raw data can be translated into high-quality predictions within a given time constraint. This process mitigates overfitting by splitting the data in various ways with careful tracking of out-of-fold examples.

The AutoGluon-Tabular algorithm performs well in machine learning competitions because of its robust handling of a variety of data types, relationships, and distributions. You can use AutoGluon-Tabular for regression, classification (binary and multiclass), and ranking problems.

Please find the demo example [here](https://github.com/ankitakotadiya/Data-Engineering-ML/blob/main/SageMaker-Buit-in-Algorithms/Amazon_Tabular_Regression_AutoGluon.ipynb).


### CatBoost
CatBoost is a popular and high-performance open-source implementation of the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm. GBDT is a supervised learning algorithm that attempts to accurately predict a target variable by combining an ensemble of estimates from a set of simpler and weaker models.
