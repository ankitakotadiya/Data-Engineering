## Amazon S3
Amazon S3, a versatile and highly scalable storage service. S3 serves as a central repository, providing a seamless solution for storing both structured and unstructured data. Its accessibility and flexibility make it an ideal choice for accommodating data from various sources, simplifying the often intricate task of managing diverse datasets.

Setting up a good system for handling data is crucial these days. It gets tricky when data is scattered all over the place. So, I'm going with Amazon S3 â€“ a handy storage service from AWS. It's like a neat, centralized bucket where we can toss in all kinds of data, whether it's well-organized or a bit messy.

Now, getting meaningful info from your data is a big deal. It's even trickier when your data is playing hide-and-seek in different spots. But with Amazon S3, we're bringing all those scattered sources together in one easy-to-reach spot. This not only makes handling data way simpler but also paves the way for doing more cool stuff with it.

First of all, I'll create a bucket and inside will set up a couple of folders within the S3 bucket. One will be called 'Input' to store incoming data, and the other will be 'Output' for the transformed data.
