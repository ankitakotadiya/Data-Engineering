# Amazon QuickSight
Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-based business intelligence (BI) service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to enable organizations to easily analyze, visualize, and share insights from their data. QuickSight allows users to create interactive dashboards, reports, and perform ad-hoc analysis, making it a powerful tool for data visualization and business intelligence.

Here are some of the benefits of using Amazon QuickSight for analytics, data visualization, and reporting:
* The in-memory engine, called SPICE, responds with blazing speed.
* No upfront costs for licenses and a low total cost of ownership (TCO).
* Collaborative analytics with no need to install an application.
* Combine a variety of data into one analysis.
* Publish and share your analysis as a dashboard.
* Control features available in a dashboard.
* No need to manage granular database permissionsâ€”dashboard viewers can see only what you share.
