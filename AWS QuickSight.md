QuickSight allows users to create interactive dashboards, reports, and perform ad-hoc analysis, making it a powerful tool for data visualization and business intelligence.

* The in-memory engine, called SPICE, responds with blazing speed.
* No upfront costs for licenses and a low total cost of ownership (TCO).
* Collaborative analytics with no need to install an application.
* Combine a variety of data into one analysis.
* Publish and share your analysis as a dashboard.
