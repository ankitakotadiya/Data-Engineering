# AWS IOT Greengrass
AWS IoT Greengrass is an open source Internet of Things (IoT) edge runtime and cloud service that helps you build, deploy and manage IoT applications on your devices. You can use AWS IoT Greengrass to build software that enables your devices to act locally on the data that they generate, run predictions based on machine learning models, and filter and aggregate device data. AWS IoT Greengrass enables your devices to collect and analyze data closer to where that data is generated, react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with other devices on the local network. Greengrass devices can also communicate securely with AWS IoT Core and export IoT data to the AWS Cloud. You can use AWS IoT Greengrass to build edge applications using pre-built software modules, called components, that can connect your edge devices to AWS services or third-party services. You can also use AWS IoT Greengrass to package and run your software using Lambda functions, Docker containers, native operating system processes, or custom runtimes of your choice.

The following example shows how an AWS IoT Greengrass device interacts with the AWS Cloud.

## How AWS IoT Greengrass works
The AWS IoT Greengrass client software, also called AWS IoT Greengrass Core software, runs on Windows and Linux-based distributions, such as Ubuntu or Raspberry Pi OS, for devices with ARM or x86 architectures. With AWS IoT Greengrass, you can program devices to act locally on the data they generate, run predictions based on machine learning models, and filter and aggregate device data. AWS IoT Greengrass enables local execution of AWS Lambda functions, Docker containers, native OS processes, or custom runtimes of your choice.

AWS IoT Greengrass provides pre-built software modules called components that let you easily extend edge device functionality. AWS IoT Greengrass components enable you to connect to AWS services and third-party applications at the edge. After you develop your IoT applications, AWS IoT Greengrass enables you to remotely deploy, configure, and manage those applications on your fleet of devices in the field.
