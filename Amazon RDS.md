# Amazon RDS
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.

## Amazon RDS DB instances
A DB instance is an isolated database environment running in the cloud. It is the basic building block of Amazon RDS. A DB instance can contain multiple user-created databases, and can be accessed using the same client tools and applications you might use to access a standalone database instance. DB instances are simple to create and modify with the AWS command line tools, Amazon RDS API operations, or the AWS Management Console.

The DB instance identifier forms part of the DNS hostname allocated to your instance by RDS. For example, if you specify db1 as the DB instance identifier, then RDS will automatically allocate a DNS endpoint for your instance. An example endpoint is db1.abcdefghijkl.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com, where db1 is your instance ID.

In the example endpoint db1.abcdefghijkl.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com, the string abcdefghijkl is a unique identifier for a specific combination of AWS Region and AWS account. The identifier abcdefghijkl in the example is internally generated by RDS and doesn't change for the specified combination of Region and account. Thus, all your DB instances in this Region share the same fixed identifier. Consider the following features of the fixed identifier:

## DB instance classes
The DB instance class determines the computation and memory capacity of an Amazon RDS DB instance. The DB instance class that you need depends on your processing power and memory requirements.

A DB instance class consists of both the DB instance class type and the size. For example, db.r6g is a memory-optimized DB instance class type powered by AWS Graviton2 processors. Within the db.r6g instance class type, db.r6g.2xlarge is a DB instance class. The size of this class is 2xlarge.

## Amazon RDS DB instance storage
DB instances for Amazon RDS for Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes for database and log storage.

In some cases, your database workload might not be able to achieve 100 percent of the IOPS that you have provisioned. 

## Supported features in Amazon RDS by AWS Region and DB engine
### Blue/Green Deployments
A blue/green deployment copies a production database environment in a separate, synchronized staging environment. By using Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments, you can make changes to the database in the staging environment without affecting the production environment. For example, you can upgrade the major or minor DB engine version, change database parameters, or make schema changes in the staging environment. When you are ready, you can promote the staging environment to be the new production database environment. For more information, see Using Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments for database updates.

### Cross-Region automated backups
By using backup replication in Amazon RDS, you can configure your RDS DB instance to replicate snapshots and transaction logs to a destination Region. When backup replication is configured for a DB instance, RDS starts a cross-Region copy of all snapshots and transaction logs when they're ready.

### Cross-Region read replicas
By using cross-Region read replicas in Amazon RDS, you can create a MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server read replica in a different Region from the source DB instance.

### Database activity streams
By using Database Activity Streams in Amazon RDS, you can monitor and set alarms for auditing activity in your Oracle database and SQL Server database. 

Database activity streams aren't available with the following engines:
* RDS for Db2
* RDS for MariaDB
* RDS for MySQL
* RDS for PostgreSQL

### Dual-stack mode
By using dual-stack mode in RDS, resources can communicate with a DB instance over Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), or both. 

### Export snapshots to S3
You can export RDS DB snapshot data to an Amazon S3 bucket. You can export all types of DB snapshotsâ€”including manual snapshots, automated system snapshots, and snapshots created by AWS Backup. After the data is exported, you can analyze the exported data directly through tools like Amazon Athena or Amazon Redshift Spectrum.

Exporting snapshots to S3 is not available for the following engines:

* RDS for Db2
* RDS for Oracle
* RDS for SQL Server

### IAM database authentication
By using IAM database authentication in Amazon RDS, you can authenticate without a password when you connect to a DB instance. Instead, you use an authentication token.

### Kerberos authentication
By using Kerberos authentication in Amazon RDS, you can support external authentication of database users using Kerberos and Microsoft Active Directory. Using Kerberos and Active Directory provides the benefits of single sign-on and centralized authentication of database users. This feature is not available for MariaDB.

### Multi-AZ DB clusters
A Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment in Amazon RDS provides a high availability deployment mode of Amazon RDS with two readable standby DB instances. A Multi-AZ DB cluster has a writer DB instance and two reader DB instances in three separate Availability Zones in the same Region. Multi-AZ DB clusters provide high availability, increased capacity for read workloads, and lower write latency when compared to Multi-AZ DB instance deployments.

Multi-AZ DB clusters aren't available with the following engines:

* RDS for Db2
* RDS for MariaDB
* RDS for Oracle
* RDS for SQL Server

### Performance Insights
Performance Insights in Amazon RDS expands on existing Amazon RDS monitoring features to illustrate and help you analyze your database performance. With the Performance Insights dashboard, you can visualize the database load on your Amazon RDS DB instance. You can also filter the load by waits, SQL statements, hosts, or users. 

### RDS Custom
Amazon RDS Custom automates database administration tasks and operations. By using RDS Custom, as a database administrator you can access and customize your database environment and operating system. With RDS Custom, you can customize to meet the requirements of legacy, custom, and packaged applications. 

### Amazon RDS Proxy
Amazon RDS Proxy is a fully managed, highly available database proxy that makes applications more scalable by pooling and sharing established database connections.

### Secrets Manager integration
With AWS Secrets Manager, you can replace hard-coded credentials in your code, including database passwords, with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret programmatically.

### Zero-ETL integrations with Amazon Redshift
RDS Zero-ETL integrations with Amazon Redshift is a fully managed solution for making transactional data available in Amazon Redshift after it's written to an Amazon RDS DB instance.

### Engine-native features
Amazon RDS database engines also support many of the most common engine-native features and functionality. These features are different than the Amazon RDS-native features listed on this page. Some engine-native features might have limited support or restricted privileges.

   * Enable deletion protection option
10. To enter your master password, do the following:
    * In the Settings section, open Credential Settings.
    * If you want to specify a password, clear the Auto generate a password check box if it is selected.
    * (Optional) Change the Master username value.
    * Enter the same password in Master password and Confirm password.
11. (Optional) Set up a connection to a compute resource for this DB instance.
    You can configure connectivity between an Amazon EC2 instance and the new DB instance during DB instance creation.
12. In the Connectivity section under VPC security group (firewall), if you select Create new, a VPC security group is created with an inbound rule that allows your local computer's IP address to access the database.
13. For the remaining sections, specify your DB instance settings.
14. Choose Create database.


## Amazon Aurora
Amazon Aurora (Aurora) is a fully managed relational database engine that's compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. You already know how MySQL and PostgreSQL combine the speed and reliability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases. The code, tools, and applications you use today with your existing MySQL and PostgreSQL databases can be used with Aurora. With some workloads, Aurora can deliver up to five times the throughput of MySQL and up to three times the throughput of PostgreSQL without requiring changes to most of your existing applications.

### Amazon Aurora DB clusters
An Amazon Aurora DB cluster consists of one or more DB instances and a cluster volume that manages the data for those DB instances. An Aurora cluster volume is a virtual database storage volume that spans multiple Availability Zones, with each Availability Zone having a copy of the DB cluster data. Two types of DB instances make up an Aurora DB cluster:

* Primary DB instance â€“ Supports read and write operations, and performs all of the data modifications to the cluster volume. Each Aurora DB cluster has one primary DB instance.
* Aurora Replica â€“ Connects to the same storage volume as the primary DB instance and supports only read operations. Each Aurora DB cluster can have up to 15 Aurora Replicas in addition to the primary DB instance. Maintain high availability by locating Aurora Replicas in separate Availability Zones. Aurora automatically fails over to an Aurora Replica in case the primary DB instance becomes unavailable. You can specify the failover priority for Aurora Replicas. Aurora Replicas can also offload read workloads from the primary DB instance.

### Supported features in Amazon Aurora by AWS Region and Aurora DB engine
Aurora MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible database engines support several Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS features and options. The support varies across specific versions of each database engine, and across AWS Regions. To identify Aurora database engine version support and availability for a feature in a given AWS Region, you can use the following sections.

Some of these features are Aurora-only capabilities. For example, Aurora Serverless, Aurora global databases, and support for integration with AWS machine learning services aren't supported by Amazon RDS. Other features, such as Amazon RDS Proxy, are supported by both Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS.
