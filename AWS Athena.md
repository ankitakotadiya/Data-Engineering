# AWS Athena
Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that enables you to analyze and query data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using SQL statements. It is a serverless service, which means you don't need to manage any infrastructure. Athena allows you to analyze large datasets stored in S3 without the need to set up and manage a complex data warehouse.
