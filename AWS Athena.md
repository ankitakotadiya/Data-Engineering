# AWS Athena
Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that enables you to analyze and query data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using SQL statements. It is a serverless service, which means you don't need to manage any infrastructure. Athena allows you to analyze large datasets stored in S3 without the need to set up and manage a complex data warehouse.

## Athena SQL
You can use Athena SQL to query your data in-place in Amazon S3 using the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
In Athena, catalogs, databases, and tables are containers for the metadata definitions that define a schema for underlying source data.

Athena uses the following terms to refer to hierarchies of data objects:
* Data source – a group of databases
* Database – a group of tables
* Table – data organized as a group of rows or columns
